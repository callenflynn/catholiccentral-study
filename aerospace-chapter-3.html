                        <h1>Chapter 3: The Golden Age of Aviation (1919-1939) Summary</h1>

                        <h2>Flying Across the Atlantic</h2>
                        <p>The big challenge after WWI was crossing the Atlantic Ocean. In 1919, the U.S. Navy tried it first with three flying boats, but only one (the NC-4) made it all the way to Europe. Two weeks later, two British pilots pulled off the first nonstop flight from Newfoundland to Ireland in just over 16 hours, winning $50,000.</p>

                        <h2>Aviation Almost Dies in America</h2>
                        <p>When WWI ended, the government nearly gave up on aviation. They canceled tons of airplane contracts, laid off 175,000 workers, and cut military aviation by 95%. Aviation almost completely died out in the U.S.</p>

                        <h2>Barnstormers Save the Day</h2>
                        <p>Luckily, ex-military pilots called "barnstormers" kept aviation alive. They flew around the country in surplus planes (mostly the famous Jenny), landed in farm fields, and gave people rides for $3-5. They also did crazy stunts like wing walking at county fairs. Without these daredevils, aviation might have disappeared completely.</p>

                        <h2>General Billy Mitchell Fights for Air Power</h2>
                        <p>General Mitchell believed airplanes would be super important in future wars. To prove it, he bombed and sank a "unsinkable" German battleship in 1921. The Army wasn't impressed, but the Navy got the message and built their first aircraft carrier within 8 months. Mitchell kept pushing for a separate Air Force, which eventually got him court-martialed, but his ideas were proven right when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941.</p>

                        <h2>Air Racing and Records</h2>
                        <p>Air races became huge in the 1920s and 30s. The Pulitzer Trophy Race started in 1920, and speeds jumped from 156 mph to nearly 250 mph in just 5 years. Women got their own races too, with pilots like Amelia Earhart competing. These races pushed airplane technology forward fast.</p>

                        <h2>Charles Lindbergh Changes Everything</h2>
                        <p>In 1927, 25-year-old Charles Lindbergh flew solo from New York to Paris in 33.5 hours, winning a $25,000 prize. This flight made him an instant world hero and got Americans excited about aviation. After his flight, thousands of people started learning to fly and hundreds of airports were built.</p>

                        <h2>Amelia Earhart and Women in Aviation</h2>
                        <p>Earhart became famous as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932. She helped start the "Ninety-Nines," an organization for female pilots. Sadly, she disappeared in 1937 while trying to fly around the world.</p>

                        <h2>Airmail Creates Commercial Aviation</h2>
                        <p>The Post Office started flying mail in 1918, which led to the first commercial airlines. Laws like the Air Mail Act of 1925 let private companies carry mail and make money doing it. This created the airline industry we know today.</p>

                        <h2>Planes Get Modern</h2>
                        <p>During the 1930s, planes changed from slow, fabric-covered biplanes to fast, all-metal monoplanes. Scientists developed better wings, retractable landing gear, and instruments for flying in bad weather. By 1938, the DC-3 was carrying 95% of all airline passengers in America.</p>

                        <h2>Preparing for War</h2>
                        <p>By 1939, war was coming and America needed way more pilots. General "Hap" Arnold started the Civilian Pilot Training Program, which trained 300,000 pilots by 1944. The famous Tuskegee Airmen program trained the first African-American military pilots, who went on to be heroes in WWII.</p>

                            <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                            <p>This period basically took aviation from a dangerous experiment to a practical part of everyday life, setting up everything for WWII and modern aviation.</p>
