                        <h1>Chapter 2: Early Aviation Developments and World War I Summary</h1>

                        <h2>The Wright Brothers Keep Improving</h2>
                        <p>After their famous 1903 flight, the Wright brothers kept perfecting their planes. By 1905, they could fly for 38 minutes and cover 24 miles. The U.S. government initially rejected their offers to build military planes (they were embarrassed by earlier failures), but President Theodore Roosevelt eventually asked them to build a plane that could carry a pilot, passenger, and fuel for 125 miles at 36 mph.</p>

                        <h2>First Aviation Tragedy</h2>
                        <p>In 1908, during Army tests, Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge became the first person to die in a powered airplane crash when a propeller broke during Orville Wright's demonstration. The Army still bought their first plane from the Wrights in 1909 for $30,000.</p>

                        <h2>Glenn Curtiss Enters the Scene</h2>
                        <p>Glenn Curtiss, who held the motorcycle speed record at 136 mph, got into aviation around 1907. He teamed up with Alexander Graham Bell to form the Aerial Experiment Association, building planes with new features like ailerons (instead of wing-warping) and the first American seaplane. By 1910, both the Wrights and Curtiss had opened flying schools.</p>

                        <h2>Notable Early Flights</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1910</strong>: Former President Theodore Roosevelt became the first president to fly</li>
                            <li><strong>1911</strong>: Calbraith Perry Rodgers tried to fly across the U.S. in 30 days for a $50,000 prize but took 49 days and missed the money</li>
                            <li><strong>1911</strong>: Harriet Quimby became America's first licensed female pilot</li>
                            <li><strong>1912</strong>: Quimby became the first woman to fly solo across the English Channel</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>European Progress</h2>
                        <p>Europe was making big advances too:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1906</strong>: Alberto Santos-Dumont flew the first powered airplane in Europe</li>
                            <li><strong>1907</strong>: Louis Bleriot built the first powered monoplane</li>
                            <li><strong>1909</strong>: Bleriot crossed the English Channel; first international air meet held in France</li>
                            <li><strong>1911</strong>: Short brothers built the first multi-engine aircraft</li>
                            <li><strong>1913</strong>: Igor Sikorsky built the first four-engine plane</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Helicopters Get Started</h2>
                        <p>Early helicopter experiments began with Louis Breguet in France (1907) and the Berliner brothers in America (1909), though these were just basic vertical lift demonstrations.</p>

                        <h2>First Commercial Airline</h2>
                        <p>In 1914, the world's first scheduled airline service started: the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line in Florida. It flew 22 miles across Tampa Bay, cost $5, and took about 20 minutes.</p>

                        <h2>America Falls Behind Militarily</h2>
                        <p>By 1912, all major countries had military air forces, but America was way behind. By 1913, the U.S. had only 19 planes and 29 pilots, while Germany had 200 aircraft and Britain/France had about 450 each. When America entered WWI in 1917, we had no combat-ready planes.</p>

                        <h2>World War I Aviation</h2>

                        <h3>Rapid Development</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Planes improved dramatically: speeds went from 70-80 mph to 140-150 mph</li>
                            <li>Flying altitude increased from 10,000 to 24,000 feet</li>
                            <li>Planes started as observation tools, then became crude bombers with pilots dropping bombs by hand</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>German Dirigibles</h3>
                        <p>Germany used dirigibles (airships) as strategic bombers against British and French cities. They were accurate but highly flammable, so they mostly flew at night.</p>

                        <h3>Fighter Development</h3>
                        <p>The air war escalated quickly:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1915</strong>: French pilot Roland Garros mounted a machine gun that fired through his propeller</li>
                            <li>Germans captured his plane and had Anthony Fokker improve the design</li>
                            <li>This gave Germany air superiority for about a year until the Allies copied the technology</li>
                            <li><strong>1918</strong>: Hugo Junkers built the first all-metal fighter plane, but it was too late to affect the war</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Fighter Aces</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Ace" meant shooting down 5 enemy planes (10 for Germans)</li>
                            <li>Eddie Rickenbacker was America's top ace with 26 kills in just 5 months</li>
                            <li>Billy Mitchell got his start in WWI and later became a major advocate for air power</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>American Disappointment</h2>
                        <p>Despite promising 263 squadrons with 22,625 aircraft by June 1918, America ended the war with only 45 squadrons flying British and French planes. Not a single American-designed combat aircraft saw action in WWI.</p>

                            <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                            <p>This chapter shows how aviation went from the Wright brothers' experiments to becoming a crucial military weapon in just 15 years, though America struggled to keep up with European developments.</p>
